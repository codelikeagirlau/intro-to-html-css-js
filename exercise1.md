# Intro to HTML, CSS and Javascript 

## Exercise 1

We're going to add some new tags into our home page, `index.html`

Note that all the website tags need to go inside the `<body>` tag

### Steps

1. Open VS Code
2. File > Open - navigate to where you have the HTML5 Boilerplate files and select the root directory
3. With your finder, navigate to `index.html`. Right click and open with Chrome. 
_(This lets you see the file rendered locally)_
4. Enter a big heading on the page using the `<h1>` tag  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp 
5. Add an unordered list using the `<ul>` tag.

6. Add some text into a `<p>` tag. Why not add a link to somewhere cool using the `<a>` tag?

7. Now we'll add an image. First, pick an image - one from your phone would be great!
8. We'll add it into the folder called `/img` 
9. Now we can embed the image in the page using the `<img>` tag

> HINT: As you add tags into your code, make sure you keep refreshing the page in Chrome to see your changes come through.

Here's an example of what your code could look like when you've completed the steps above:
