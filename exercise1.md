# Exercise 1

We're going to add some new tags into our home page, `index.html`

Note that all the website tags need to go inside the `<body>` tag

### Steps

> Hint: Don't forget to save each time you make changes to a file!

1.  Open VS Code

    * Click File > Open
    * Select the folder containing the HTML5 Boilerplate files (this is called the root directory)
    * Click on `index.html` to see the main index (in your file navigator on the left)

2.  On your OS (Mac Finder / Windows Explorer)

    * Open the folder with HTML5 Boilerplate files on your computer.
    * Right click `index.html` and open with Chrome.
      _(This lets you see the file rendered locally. Refresh to see changes.)_

3.  Add new tags to the page

    * Pop these anywhere inside the `<body>` tag.
    * Enter a big heading on the page using the `<h1>` tag

    * Add an unordered list using the `<ul>` tag.

    * Add some text into a `<p>` tag.

    * Try a link to somewhere cool using the `<a>` tag

4.  Add an image to the page

    * First, pick an image - one from your phone or computer would be great!
    * If your image has spaces in the name, you want to remove them
      e.g. `My Cool Image.jpg` -> `My-Cool-Image.jpg`
    * Now we want to drop our image into the folder called `/img`
    * Now we can embed the image in the page using the `<img>` tag
      https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp
    * Note that we need to use a relative path to the image because these files aren't hosted online anywhere yet

> HINT: As you add tags into your code, make sure you keep refreshing the page in Chrome to see your changes come through.
