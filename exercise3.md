# Exercise 3

We're going to add some JS behaviour to our document now!

### Steps

1. Let's add an alert dialog to our window with javascript. 
We're going to do this inside the `<body>` tag of our HTML index file. Start  by copying the example code, and once you can see it working, try changing the function name, the button text, and the words which appear in the dialog box:

2. Another example is to fetch and display the computer's time on your page. We're going to do that with a button on the page which performs the function of getting the Date from your computer's clock with the method `Date()`, and writing it to the page with `innerHTML`.
